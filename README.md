# CPU Scheduling Simulator

A simple web-based CPU Scheduling Simulator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to simulate and visualize different CPU scheduling algorithms such as:

- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Priority Scheduling
- Round Robin (RR)

## Features

- User input for number of processes, burst time, arrival time, and priority.
- Option to select scheduling algorithm and set quantum for Round Robin.
- Dynamic Gantt chart generation.
- Calculation of Completion Time (CT), Turnaround Time (TAT), and Waiting Time (WT).
- Displays average TAT and WT.
- Responsive and user-friendly UI.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern browser.
2. Enter the number of processes and click "Generate Form".
3. Fill in the process details.
4. Choose a scheduling algorithm and set quantum if using RR.
5. Click "Simulate" to view the Gantt chart and results.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
